/* 
Create a variable called word that contains a hangman word,
 and create a second variable called letter that indicates the letter that the player guessed.
 How many times does a letter exist 
  - Print out "Yeah, the letter x exists y times in my word" if the letter exists (but substitute the actual letter and the number of times)
  - If the letter doesn't exist, print out "Nope, that letter doesn't exist in my word."

  input: creature
  output: guessed letter
